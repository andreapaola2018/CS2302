For this lab, I implemented different types of graphs and search algorithms in order to come up with a solution for a puzzle. The main purpose of this lab is 
to find six different solutions to the fox, chicken, and sack of grain problem. The different types of graphs were used and implemented with two search algorithms, 
breadth-first search and depth-first search. The search algorithms were then used to find valid paths to solve the problem.
